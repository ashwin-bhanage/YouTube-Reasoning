      "golden_answer_guidance": "A correct answer must highlight Spring Boot's simplified, annotation-driven approach for common API/ORM tasks versus the 'takes a while' aspect of JWT security, inferring its focus on rapid development of typical REST API components rather than complex cross-cutting concerns.",

      "golden_answer_guidance": "A correct answer should infer that Spring Boot builds upon and simplifies the existing Spring framework, suggesting it provides a more opinionated, streamlined, and 'out-of-the-box' experience, thereby accelerating development for existing Spring users by reducing manual configuration.",

Reconcile these seemingly conflicting statements by explaining how Spring Boot delivers on its rapid development promise for core functionality despite more complex features requiring additional effort.",
      "domain": "tech",
      "difficulty": "hard",
      "golden_answer_guidance": "A correct answer should explain that Spring Boot's rapid development applies to initial setup and basic API exposure, achieved through minimal configuration and annotation usage, whereas specialized, non-core features like advanced security inherently demand deeper understanding and more detailed, custom configuration.",
