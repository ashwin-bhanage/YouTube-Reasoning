      "difficulty": "medium",
      "golden_answer_guidance": "A correct answer should discuss how the reaction would likely reference NF's known introspective style, perhaps mentioning specific thematic elements common in his prior tracks to highlight the contrast with 'FEAR,' and analyze how the new song's tone or lyrics (even if inferred from the title) might represent a departure.",

      "golden_answer_guidance": "The answer should identify the immediacy and raw emotional response as strengths, offering insight into initial listener impact.

It highlights an attempt to process the artist's message and personal resonance.",
